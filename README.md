# Lab 12 – Implementing and Applying the Set

# Description

This lab implements a Set Abstract Data Type (ADT) using a hash table (with separate chaining) to perform set operations on student enrollment data. The program reads student IDs from two course CSV files, applies set operations, and displays results such as:

- Students enrolled in both courses
- Students enrolled only in Course A
- Students enrolled only in Course B
- All students enrolled in either course

This demonstrates an applied understanding of data structures, especially sets and hash tables.
